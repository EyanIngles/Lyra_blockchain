    Created Dev_logs.md file to provide a written overview of the works completed over time with small details.)

    - Created: created the start of how the transactions will be expected to be used, added Address Struct to wallet where we can define what we expect from an address on the blockchain, this will save fake addresses from being imported without additional checks, this way we can keep track on wallets created, and ensure they are alligning with blockchain requirements.

    - Created: Created the start of tokens with it being pushed onto the tokens branch, this way i can keep things seperate and testing what is only relevant to the current building and also to keep myself focused on this particular task. While creating the token and taking into consideration scammers and people hacking the system, I then remembered about the ERC-20 standard. With this all in mind, I think its safe to create our own standard that the Lyra blockchain will strictly follow and allow. Drawbacks? yes, I expect there to be less people flooding the market due to a strict diet, but I think honesty is most important.
